# jumpy_boy
This is a game modeled after game "Doodle Jump". 
It requires the [ge211](https://tov.github.io/ge211/) game engine to run.
This was submitted as a Final Project for CS211 (Fundamentals of Computer Programming II).

## How it works

When the game is properly loaded, you will see a window similar to this. 

Press space bar to start and Jumpy Boy will start to jump up and down!

As Jumpy Boy moves up by stepping on the blocks, your score will go up. 

As soon as Jumpy Boy hits a red obstacle, game will be over and your score will show on the screen.
